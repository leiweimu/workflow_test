===========

SketchyOpts is a `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/>`_ library for sketching-based methods. 

The primary goal is to provide accessible and efficient implementation of these methods to the scientific community. To this end, the library follows design philosophies of `Optax <https://optax.readthedocs.io/>`_ and structures optimizers into composable blocks. We hope the library facilitates research productivity and leads to new ideas and exciting solutions.
